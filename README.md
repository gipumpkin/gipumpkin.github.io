This repo is for use as part of a jekyll tutorial for the Penn Digital Scholarship Fellows (and our friENDs). 
## Notes for teaching jekyll.

Because this is for students part-way through their fellowship, it assumes that you can find command line and that you have [atom](https://atom.io/) or another text editor that shows directory trees and makes things in nice colors.

This is not a tutorial for "easiest way to get Jekyll up and running." Instead, it's a repository to be used along with an in person workshop about getting to know how jekyll works. Also, this site is not meant as a standalone tutorial. It assumes that I (Laurie) am interjecting to explain things, and guide people. I should, and might, also turn it into a standalone tutorial, but at the moment it's not one. There are great tutorials for standalone learning! I will add links to some of them. 

### Installing jekyll

#### For macs

1. Open Terminal
1. Try installing basic jekyll site using the commands at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).
1. Open a new project in Atom and import your new directory.

#### For Windows
1. Closely follow all of the instructions on [installing jekyll on windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/) based on which Windows Operating system you use.
1. Open a new project in Atom and import your new directory.

Pause here to make sure everything works. Troubleshoot.
Now, into how and why it works. Also, what is [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Looking around jekyll

1. On your page, navigate to the about page.
1. Go to the about.md file in atom and make a change. Check out the changes to the page.
1. Now, CTRL C to stop your server, and type "jekyll build".  
1. Take a look at the site folder. Zip it up and move it to your web folder on reclaim.

### Digging a little deeper

This jekyll site is built using a theme. At the [Jekyll Theme Page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) you can see how they're hiding some of the directories from immediate view.
1. Show my repo that has all of the parts of jekyll stored in the same place.
1. download that repo to your computer, save it somewhere reasonable (the desktop will probably work for this workshop), navigate into it, and jekyll build.
1. Take a look around the directories.
1. Explore the files, and see where they point. (It's easiest if you save the blog for last).

### Working with data
1. Take a look at the mlab-data page.
1. Try to create a page for the END data I've added to the END folder.
