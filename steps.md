1. Now, CTRL C to stop your server, and type "jekyll build".  
1. Take a look at the site folder. Zip it up and move it to your web folder on reclaim.

This jekyll site is built using a theme. At the [Jekyll Theme Page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) you can see how they're hiding some of the directories from immediate view.
1. Show my repo that has all of the parts of jekyll stored in the same place.
1. download that repo to your computer, save it somewhere reasonable (the desktop will probably work for this workshop), navigate into it, and jekyll build.
1. Take a look around the directories.
1. Explore the files, and see where they point. (It's easiest if you save the blog for last).

### Working with data
